# Tic Tac Toe
### Description
Extremely simple TicTacToe project done for first semester of uni. Takes in user input (1-9) for the player and outputs random number for the computer's turn. The reason this is public is to display my early unit tests in TicTacToe/src/tictactoepackage/TicTacToeTest.java
